Development Best Practices
Code Quality and Standards

    Adhere to PEP 8 style guide for Python for readability and maintainability

    Use descriptive variable names to clarify intent

    Maintain clean, modular code structure

Environment

    Use virtual environments (e.g., venv) to isolate dependencies

    Manage dependencies with requirements.txt or pipenv

Framework and Libraries

    Implement backend logic using a robust Python web framework such as Django, Flask, or FastAPI depending on complexity and performance needs

    Use templating engines like Django templates or Jinja2 for HTML

Testing and Deployment

    Develop and maintain testing suites to cover unit and integration tests

    Automate deployment using CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to build and deploy your application

Performance

    Optimize Python code by using built-in functions and list comprehensions

    Ensure efficient database interactions with ORM best practices

    Utilize caching mechanisms where appropriate to improve response times

Security

    Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms

    Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks

    Use HTTPS and secure cookie handling

Suggested CI/CD Workflow for Penzihalisi (Python Application)

A workflow can be configured in .github/workflows/python-app.yml for automatic testing and deployment on pushes to main branch:

name: Python Application CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest  # or your preferred test runner
